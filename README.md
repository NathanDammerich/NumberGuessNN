# NumberGuessNN
# This Multi-Layer-Perceptron Neural Network labels handwritten numbers.
# The architecture consists of three hidden layers, with the first two layers containing 64 neurons each, 
# and the last layer containing 10 neurons.
# 
# The neural network was trained using the MNIST database. After rigorous training, this neural network was able to achieve an
# accuracy of about 99.95% when tested against other entries in the MNIST database.

# To test the program, run the NumberLabeler.py file.
